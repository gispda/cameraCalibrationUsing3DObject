# cameraCalibrationUsing3DObject

This code is for transforming Camera co-ordinates into 2D co-ordinates and calibrating a camera.

Using this code, you can find out the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera using a 3D real world object.

**imPoints2D** :: co-ordinates of points in **2D** Image
**objectPoints3D** :: co-ordinates of the same points on **3D** Object
